## Project Overview 
We carry out Analysis between variables like **West Texas intermediate(WTI),Gold Futures , US Dollar Index Futures, US 10 Year Bond Yield,Gold Futures, S&P 500,Dow Jones Utility Average**. 
Experiment out different **outliers techniques** like (1)**Zscore**,(2)**Removing Financial Crisis** Period (2007-2009 recession period) and (3)**Mahalanobis Distance** .
We then carry out comparision by observing **forecasting differences** across two models **Long Term Short Memory(LSTM) and Gated Re-current Unit(GRU)**.

## Motivation
Browsing methods for forecasting time series problems, I came across Deep Neural Network Techniques like LSTM and GRU, as well as a method of using multiple explanatory variables to account for many effects to account for economic changes,etc.
Oil seemed interesting to me as an all-too-common fall guy for the state of the economy.
It was a interesting project to forecast oil price and observe its relationship to some economic variables like Gold Futures,Interest rates and Market Indices,etc.


## Problem Type
Time Series Forecasting Problem-Solved Using LSTM and GRU.

**Result Metrics**

Mean Squared Error(MSE),Mean Absolute Error(MAE), R2 Score.

## Actionable Insight
Understanding behaviour of Oil price and whether to invest it in or not.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.6**
- **Pandas**        
- **Matplotlib**        
- **Sklearn**            
- **Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels**      
- **Scipy** 
- **Keras with Tensorflow Backend**
- **Plotly** 



       

## About the Data
Individual Data series was collected from Investing.com site (https://www.investing.com/) and Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/). 
Time period for data ranges between 4th Jan 2000 to 10th June 2019 with Daily frequency containing 4947 records in total and 7 series in total.
The following series -(WTI ,Gold Futures , US Dollar Index Futures, US 10 Year Bond Yield,Gold Futures, S&P 500, )-Investing.com and (Dow Jones Utility Average)-Yahoo Finance.

## Initial Preprocessing 
To work on the dataset similar to the project, the following steps were carried out .

-> We collect individual time series within the same range for each feature.

-> Using VlookUp from Excel we merge the series into one dataset , we do so by the dates to align it according to the target variable WTI.

***Note***: We have put both individual time series and combined dataset in the data folder of this repo..
